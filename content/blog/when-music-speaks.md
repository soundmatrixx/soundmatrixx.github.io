## An artistic expression in music is what gives life to frequencies.

A particular arrangement of notes and words can make you long for something that doesn’t even exist. It can make you cry for someone who was never part of your world. It can make you smile for reasons you can’t explain.

Unlike looking at a painting or reading a novel, you don’t need to understand music to _feel_ it. You don’t need context or translation. Music bypasses logic and goes straight to the heart.

If you think music is just physical vibrations—air molecules hitting your eardrums—think again.

When you listen to **"**[**Felitsa**](https://youtu.be/Hwr0TU0M3g0)**" by Yanni**, it’s those same vibrations that somehow make you believe in a mother’s love. When you hear [**John Williams' theme in _Schindler’s List_**](https://youtu.be/cLgJQ8Zj3AA), it's a bow moving across strings—but somehow, it makes you mourn for the lives of people you’ve never met.

If you want to know how it feels to meet your distant love for the first time—without speaking a word—listen to [_Experience_](https://youtu.be/1e9B31FLT-s) by Ludovico Einaudi, or you can listen to Elegy by Lisa Gerrard & Patrick Cassidy to mourn for a love that was never meant to last.

If music could be defined as the arrangement of sound, then the Pied Butcherbird would surely be a celebrity in the avian world. Nature is full of such artists—life forms that have mastered the art of shaping vibrations and arranging them into meaning. And among them, humans hold a special place.

If we were to compare life forms through the lens of intelligence, music might be one of the most remarkable traits we could be known for - a signature of our creativity.

Take, for example, _Mozart’s Requiem_, _Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony_, or _Stravinsky’s The Rite of Spring_—grand symphonies of emotional complexity and structural genius. Just imagine: these were not carved into stone or born by instinct—they were crafted from silence by one of the most intricate matters in the known universe: the human brain.

And that, in itself, is something to be in awe of.

Music is subjective—each listener brings their own story, emotion, and perspective to what they hear. But when the arrangement of sound is combined with language, music takes on a clearer, more direct meaning. Words give shape to emotion.

A song written for a lost love, with lyrics describing the pain and longing, will likely be interpreted the same way by listeners—even if the details differ. Each person may connect through their own life experience, but the words steer the music, giving it a shared emotional dimension.

The songwriter—who crafts both the music and the message—belongs to the same lineage as the composers of the great masterpieces we still admire. 

True, it may not be fair to compare today’s songwriters directly to the legends of classical music. The world has changed. We live in a complex web of cultures, distractions, and sociological constructs that influence what we create and how we consume art.

But the core act remains the same: to take the intangible—feeling, thought, memory—and make it heard.

The process of songwriting is exquisite in its own way. Take [_Yesterday_](https://youtu.be/fCV9oqtwyVA) by The Beatles, for example. Paul McCartney quite literally dreamed the melody one morning while sleeping in the attic bedroom of his girlfriend’s family home. The location itself isn’t particularly remarkable—but the act of _dreaming_ a melody is a beautiful phenomenon in itself. It suggests when our mind is truly immersed in the art form, creativity can still continue even when we sleep.

The song isn’t as complex or grand in scale as Mahler’s Eighth Symphony, often called the “Symphony of a Thousand.” Yet, in its simplicity, _Yesterday_ achieves something just as powerful. The gentle arrangement and heartfelt lyrics bring to life the idea that _sometimes, the simplest things can be the most fulfilling_—and that, too, is timeless.

Music transcends language barriers, carrying messages in a way anyone can understand. Even when words become a hurdle, melodies and harmonies still find a path to our hearts and convey the emotions they were meant to share. Music reminds us that feelings can be heard beyond the limits of speech.

If you are a songwriter or aspiring to become one, remember that you are part of the community keeping this art form alive. With nearly 8 billion people in the world, we certainly won't run out of songs or songwriters. But we must ask ourselves: will the next generation still see songwriting as something special, something to aspire to? It's up to us to nurture that spark now, so tomorrow's artists continue to find magic in this craft.

This blog is the start of a new journey—one that dives into the hearts and minds of those who create music. We call it "Stories Behind the Frequencies"—a weekly series that shines a light on local and emerging songwriters and composers, exploring the inspiration behind their melodies and words. Each week, we'll bring you a step closer to their world of sound, to the frequencies that carry their emotions. In doing so, we hope to celebrate the _unsung heroes_ behind the songs and invite you into the intimate spaces where music is born.

If you or someone you know is a songwriter, reach out to us at Soundmatrixx. We want to help make their story known and their voice heard—even among the herd.
